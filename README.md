# Huffman Compression and Decompression Program with GUI


## Overview

The Huffman Compression and Decompression Program with GUI is a user-friendly tool developed to compress and decompress files using the Huffman algorithm. It combines the efficiency of C for algorithm implementation with the versatility of Python's `tkinter` library for creating an intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Efficient Algorithm Implementation**: Utilizes C for implementing the Huffman algorithm, ensuring high performance and efficiency in compression and decompression processes.
- **Versatile Graphical User Interface**: Python's `tkinter` library is used to create a versatile graphical interface that simplifies file selection, compression, and decompression operations for users.
- **Lossless Compression**: Implements the Huffman algorithm to achieve lossless data compression, preserving the original data integrity during compression and decompression.
- **Ease of Use**: Combines the power of C for algorithm efficiency with the simplicity and ease of Python's `tkinter` library, providing users with a straightforward and intuitive compression and decompression experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Algorithm Implementation**: C
- **Graphical User Interface**: Python with Tkinter
